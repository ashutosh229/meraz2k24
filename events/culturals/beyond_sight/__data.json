In this event, participants will engage in a blind painting challenge where communication becomes the brushstroke and imagination takes center stage. The competition is designed to explore the power of collaboration and the limitless potential of creativity, even in the absence of sight. This is a blind painting event where participants come in pairs, one is the blindfolded artist who puts on a blind fold and picks up the brush, the other is the guide who instructs using words only.","Brushstrokes and Blunders: A Hilarious Art Adventure!","6000","Offline",[11,14],{"name":12,"contact":13},"Aviral Saxena","9755733558",{"name":15,"contact":16},"Ashtha priya","6204411316"],"uses":{"params":["type","event"]}}]}
